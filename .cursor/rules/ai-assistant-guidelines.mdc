# AI Assistant Guidelines

## Execution Flow

1. **Discovery first**: Run a brief read-only scan (grep, codebase_search, read_file) before making edits.
2. **Parallel tool calls**: Batch read-only operations; run multiple independent calls concurrently.
3. **After edits**: Run tests/build; fix failures before marking tasks complete.
4. **Status updates**: Brief progress notes before tool batches; concise summary at the end.

## Tool Usage

- **Grep** is the main exploration tool. Start broad, then narrow.
- Prefer discoverable info over asking the user.
- Re-read files before editing if not recently opened.

## Code Style

- **Naming**: Meaningful variable/function names; avoid 1–2 char names. Examples: `generateDateString` not `genYmdStr`, `numSuccessfulRequests` not `n`.
- **Control flow**: Guard clauses, early returns; avoid nesting beyond 2–3 levels.
- **Comments**: Only for non-obvious code; explain "why" not "how". No inline comments—place above the line.
- **Formatting**: Match existing style; prefer multi-line over complex ternaries; wrap long lines.

## Communication

- Use backticks for file/dir/function names (e.g. `src/App.vue`).
- Format only relevant snippets in Markdown code fences.
- Keep summaries short, high-signal, non-repetitive.
- State assumptions; don't stop for approval unless blocked.
